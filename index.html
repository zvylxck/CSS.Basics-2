 <h1>The Darker Things In Life</h1>
 <h2>Here, I will introduce you to the darker side of life</h2>   
<h3>I feel as if it isn't a bad thing and should be embraced more</h3>
<p>Things such as death, sorrow and sadness aren't bad things.
</p>
    
<p>People will sometimes lose a loved one and need to get it off if their chest and talk to someone about it so they can reduce the chances of them potentially harming themselves. </p>
 <p>Sadness, such a terrible thing for anyone to go through. Feeling as if they had done something wrong or hurt someone on purpose. People shouldn't blame themselves and harm themselves because of something that's on their mind. People have to understand that not everything is their fault. </p>   
<p> This topic has many ties to mental health and the effects that death, sorrow and sadness may have on a person's mental health. Some things that I would recommend for someone going through a mental health crisis are going to a therapist, finding every-day activities that they enjoy, and listening to music, not the sad music, but instead joyful and energetic music.</p>
